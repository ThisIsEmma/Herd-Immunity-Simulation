1 - What were the inputs you gave the simulation? (Population size, percent vaccinated, virus name, mortality rate, reproductive rate)

I ran the simulation with inputs 'ebola', '0.25', '0.70', '100000', '0.90', '10'. (More precisely, I entered 'python3 simulation.py ebola 0.25 0.70 100000 0.90 10' in the terminal)

2 - What percentage of the population became infected at some point before the virus burned out?

Out of a 100 000 individuals, ~10% (9989 persons) of the population were infected before the virus eventually burned out and simulation ended

3 - What percentage of the population died from the virus?

6.92% of the population died from the virus 

4 - Out of all interactions sick individuals had during the entire simulation, how many times, in total, did a vaccination save someone from potentially becoming infected?

from over 1 014 400 interations, 6921 interaction resulted in death while 3069 interaction resulted in survival (and immunization). 
This would mean that the remaining 1 004 410 interactions where interaction not leading to infection because the persons were already vaccinated.
