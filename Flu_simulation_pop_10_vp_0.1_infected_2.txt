            ---------------------------------END OF SIMULATION---------------------------------
            Simulation ended because all members of the population (except for initialy infected**) are either vaccinated or dead
 
            100 interactions happened in the simulation.
            RESULTS:

            Initial infected: 2

            Total deaths: 6 

            Total living (incl. initial infected): 4 

            Total persons that have been infected (excl. initialy infected): 7 

            Total number of vaccinated and alive (incl. survivors and initially vaccinated): 2** 

            Number of interactions resulting in vaccination and survival: 1.0

            Number of interactions resulting in death: 6

            ** (Total number of vaccinated includes initially infected that we are considering vaccinated as we opted not to test mortality of initially, per FAQ question-2 answer.)
